# General

This web app is was done as part of a project of the 'Developing Data Products' module of the Coursera specialization course 'Data  Science'. The main project outline was as follows:

>The application must include the following:

>1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
>2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
>3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
>4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
>5. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
